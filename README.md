## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the project, you must install the required Python libraries. Start by installing the necessary libraries as follows:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following commands **one after the other**:

```bash
pip install requests
```

```bash
pip install selenium
```
## 2. Run ChromeDriver Installation Script

After installing the dependencies, run the `Install_ChromeDriver.py` script 3 times to ensure the correct version of ChromeDriver is installed and configured properly.

**Steps:**

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt.** This is a program where you can type commands to interact with your computer. It's often referred to as a console or terminal window. 
2. **Run the script by executing:**

```bash
python Install_ChromeDriver.py
```
Repeat:

- Execute the command python Install_ChromeDriver.py two more times. This ensures proper setup. In total, you should run the script three times.
